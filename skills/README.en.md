# Skills: a reader's guide to the twelve executable skills

English · [中文](README.md)

If you clicked into this folder, you probably want to know what the "executable core" of Supervisor-Skills actually is. This README is written for you: **use it as a structured research checklist without installing anything, and as a map to what each skill does, when to trigger it, and how the skills chain together after installation as Agent Skills.**

## Where this README sits in the project

Supervisor-Skills is layered by audience:

| Entry point | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Top-level [`README.en.md`](../README.en.md) | First-time visitors | Why the project exists, tutorial structure, how to install |
| [`handbook/`](../handbook/) (Chinese, canonical) / [`handbook-en/`](../handbook-en/) (English mirror) | Readers who want the methodology | Six chapters of research and writing handbook (the theoretical spine) |
| **This file** | Readers who want the skills directly | **What each of the 12 skills is, when to use it, how it chains with the others** |
| `SKILL.md` (inside each skill directory) | Agent runtimes / LLMs | Executable spec: integrity gates, output formats, mode options — machine-readable, not optimised for human browsing |

In one line: **the handbook teaches the way, SKILL.md runs the tool, this README is the bridge between them.**

## Two narrative tracks: technical paper vs benchmark paper

The twelve skills are not isolated tools. They map to two complete lifecycles of a top-venue paper and add survey-grade research and maintainable baseline tables on the research side, evidence-gated drafting and polishing on the output side, and an execution-oriented Draw.io reconstruction capability. Locate yourself on the right track first, then pick the skill you need.

### Track 1: technical / position paper (new method for an existing problem)

Following the natural order a PhD student takes for their first top-venue paper:

1. **[idea-evaluator](idea-evaluator/SKILL.md)** — before committing months to an idea, run the reviewer-grade vetting; cut weak ideas early and sharpen the promising ones
2. **[tech-paper-template](tech-paper-template/SKILL.md)** — before writing any prose, lock the full logical skeleton of the paper
3. **[intro-drafter](intro-drafter/SKILL.md)** — write the skeleton straight into six paragraphs of Introduction prose with retrieval-verified citations (outline mode on request)
4. **[paper-writer](paper-writer/SKILL.md)** — evidence-gated drafting for every other section, from one paragraph to the full manuscript, with nothing fabricated
5. **[figure-designer](figure-designer/SKILL.md)** — design the three load-bearing figures: Motivated Example, Solution Overview, Experimental Results
6. **[drawio-reconstruction](drawio-reconstruction/SKILL.md)** — when a reference image, draft, or screenshot already exists, rebuild it as editable Draw.io
7. **[paper-polish](paper-polish/SKILL.md)** — meaning-preserving language polish: AI-tone removal, claim calibration, Chinese-to-English rewriting
8. **[pre-submission-reviewer](pre-submission-reviewer/SKILL.md)** — the 3-to-5-day deadline-window audit

**Two cross-cutting tools**, orthogonal to the eight steps above:

- [deep-research](deep-research/SKILL.md) — survey-grade literature investigation, usable before topic selection or at any point while writing: multi-perspective search, per-citation verification, a report that answers explicit research questions
- [vibe-research-workflow](vibe-research-workflow/SKILL.md) — whether you are coding, drawing, or writing at any stage, it gives you AI-collaboration rules and tool picks

### Track 2: benchmark / evaluation paper

The benchmark pipeline is more strictly sequential than the technical-paper track: each stage gates the next. **[benchmark-paper-template](benchmark-paper-template/SKILL.md)** is the orchestrator for this track: a single skill bundles the full six-stage workflow (Gap → Design → Construction → Experiments → Paper Structure → Checklist) and produces the five-pillar framework (Research Gap, Construction Pipeline, Evaluation Framework, Empirical Findings, optional Companion Method).

For a benchmark paper, the starting and ending point are both this one skill; the two core figures additionally need figure-designer, existing reference images or screenshots can be executed with drawio-reconstruction, and the pre-submission audit still lands on pre-submission-reviewer.

If what you need is not **designing a new benchmark** but **a cross-comparison table over existing benchmarks** (who has run on TOFU or MUSE, with what numbers, and which of them you should reproduce), that is the job of **[benchmark-baseline-table](benchmark-baseline-table/SKILL.md)**: it turns a batch of papers into a maintainable two-file table and freezes a reproducible baseline for your own experiments.

### Already stuck somewhere?

Readers with a specific bottleneck can skip the reading order and jump straight to the relevant skill:
- No concrete idea yet, need the lay of the land first → **deep-research**
- Not confident about greenlighting an idea → **idea-evaluator**
- Introduction reads like a set of disconnected claims, or you want the Intro prose directly → **intro-drafter**
- Methodology section will not flow → **tech-paper-template**
- Idea and results in hand, want a section written → **paper-writer**
- Prose is stiff, AI-flavored, or a Chinese draft needs submission English → **paper-polish**
- Figures look clumsy, not sure which tool to use → **figure-designer**
- Have a reference figure, paper figure, architecture diagram, or screenshot and need editable Draw.io → **drawio-reconstruction**
- Pre-submission panic, unclear what to check → **pre-submission-reviewer**
- Cannot articulate the benchmark gap or organise evaluation dimensions → **benchmark-paper-template**
- Need to turn a pile of papers into a maintainable comparison table and freeze a reproducible baseline → **benchmark-baseline-table**
- Unsure how to delegate to AI without diluting academic judgment → **vibe-research-workflow**

## The twelve skill cards

Each card translates the SKILL.md spec into plain-reader language, adds the matching handbook chapters, and notes the upstream/downstream skills.

### idea-evaluator — pre-submission vetting for your idea

- **Positioning**: externalises the implicit check that experienced advisors run silently when a student proposes an idea, into four layers of reviewable gates.
- **When to trigger**:
  - Student proposes an idea and wants to know, before committing months, whether it is worth pursuing
  - Reviewer-style self-audit: is this already covered by prior work; does it land cleanly on Higher / Faster / Stronger / Cheaper / Broader; does the student's capability and timeline fit
  - Rough-filter a list of ideas, keep the top three, cut the rest
- **Four layers**: fatal-flaws audit (early short-circuit) → idea lifecycle and student capability matching → five-dimension scoring (Higher, Faster, Stronger, Cheaper, Broader) → paradigm-shift probe plus feasibility. The order matters — a seven-out-of-ten "Higher" score means nothing if a CRITICAL fatal flaw is sitting underneath it.
- **Output**: evidence-grounded scores on every axis, severity tagging (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR), and a verdict of "Reject and Pivot" or "Proceed with Guardrails".
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [2.1 Idea lifecycle](../handbook-en/02_Idea_Generation/2.1_idea-lifecycle-and-capability-matching.md) · [2.2 Higher-Faster-Stronger](../handbook-en/02_Idea_Generation/2.2_higher-faster-stronger.md) · [2.3 Disruptive innovation](../handbook-en/02_Idea_Generation/2.3_disruptive-innovation.md)
- **Downstream**: once the idea passes, hand off to **tech-paper-template** to lock the skeleton. When the paradigm probe flags disruptive potential, read handbook 2.3 first.

### deep-research — survey-grade literature investigation

- **Positioning**: investigates a research direction the way a real survey paper is written: freeze two or three explicit research questions, search independently from three to five perspectives (mainstream, critics, adjacent fields, methodology, application and policy), verify every citation, synthesize into a MECE taxonomy with in-sentence cross-comparison, and answer the research questions one by one.
- **When to trigger**:
  - No concrete idea yet; you need the field's key works, debates, and gaps mapped first
  - idea-evaluator or a drafting skill reveals the literature map is missing
  - You need a reliable, judgment-bearing survey report, not a list of search results
- **Key discipline**: zero tolerance for invented citations (grey zone means unused); contradictions presented with condition analysis, never averaged; claim strength capped by evidence strength; six internal quality gates (angle, coverage, citation, taxonomy, calibration, weaving) send failures back for targeted re-scouting.
- **Output**: a survey-structured report: abstract, research questions, methodology, taxonomy, branch analyses with comparison tables, cross-branch synthesis, open problems, conclusions answering each RQ, verified references.
- **Downstream**: **idea-evaluator** (evaluate a specific idea once the landscape is clear) or **paper-writer** (the literature pool for Related Work).

### tech-paper-template — the logical skeleton before you write

- **Positioning**: forces alignment across Background, Limitations, Key Idea / Goal, Challenges, Methodology Modules, and Contributions, via a thinking-template table.
- **When to trigger**:
  - The idea has passed evaluation; before any prose, you want the story straight
  - Co-authors disagree on whether module X belongs — let the table arbitrate
  - Halfway through drafting you notice the method does not actually respond to the motivation — come back to the table and reshuffle
- **Key discipline**: choose the paper's **positioning type** once (technical / position paper vs new-problem / new-setting paper); enforce the challenge-to-module one-to-one mapping with at most three entries; every contribution bullet must cite the section that delivers it.
- **Output**: a completed thinking-template table + self-consistency audit (the "challenge—module—contribution" three-way interlock) + structured input ready for intro-drafter.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [3.1 Essentials of a research paper](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.1_the-essentials-of-a-research-paper.md) · [3.3 Technical paper template](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.3_technical-paper-template.md)
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **idea-evaluator**; downstream is **intro-drafter** (turn the skeleton into a six-paragraph outline) and **figure-designer** (fix the Solution Overview figure around the module graph).

### intro-drafter — six paragraphs of Introduction prose

- **Positioning**: uses the six-paragraph flowchart (Background, Limitations, Goal, Challenges, Solution Overview, Contributions) as an **internal scaffold** and delivers six paragraphs of flowing Introduction prose; the five cross-paragraph chains are checked silently before writing, and no scaffolding appears in the output.
- **When to trigger**:
  - The tech-paper-template skeleton is done; you want the Introduction written
  - You have a paragraph of research thinking and want finished prose, not bullets
  - You only want the skeleton: say "just the outline" and the classic outline mode returns
- **Key discipline**: search before writing (a full Introduction typically weaves 15-25 verified references); running examples are never fabricated (absent a real case from the user, the background paragraph stays abstract and the closing note asks for one); the shared evidence discipline with paper-writer applies (zero placeholder tags, no invented specifics).
- **Output**: six paragraphs of Introduction prose + a References list matched bidirectionally + at most three lines of closing notes.
- **Matching handbook chapter**: [3.2 Introduction writing flowchart](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.2_introduction-writing-flowchart.md)
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **tech-paper-template**; downstream is **figure-designer** (the Running Example from paragraph 1 becomes the Motivated Example figure) and **paper-writer** (every other section).

### paper-writer — evidence-gated paper drafting

- **Positioning**: turns ideas and materials into submittable paper prose, one paragraph or a full manuscript; every written word must trace to evidence. The substance (ideas, designs, results, conclusions) belongs to the author; the skill owns only its linguistic realization.
- **When to trigger**:
  - "Write this idea into a Discussion / Methods / Related Work paragraph"
  - "Draft the full first version of the paper" (STEM Introductions route to intro-drafter automatically)
  - Non-STEM sections (humanities, social science, economics, law), planned paragraph by paragraph on a CER skeleton
- **Key discipline**: factual claims have exactly three legitimate origins (user materials, this session's verified retrieval, or field common knowledge with no numbers, names, or comparisons), never model memory; zero placeholder tags, the only resolution path is search, rewrite, or delete; full papers, final mode, or three-plus citations trigger the **independent citation verification** (a fresh-context sub-agent checks every entry, with honest degradation and disclosure when the environment lacks sub-agents).
- **Output**: clean section or manuscript prose + a bidirectionally matched References list + at most three lines of notes; full-paper runs keep an evidence map and chapter blueprint as separate working files.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [3.1 Essentials](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.1_the-essentials-of-a-research-paper.md) · [3.3 Technical paper template](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.3_technical-paper-template.md) · [3.5 Writing details](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.5_writing-details-and-checklist.md)
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **tech-paper-template** (skeleton) and **intro-drafter** (Introduction prose); downstream is **paper-polish** (language) and **pre-submission-reviewer** (final audit).

### benchmark-paper-template — the all-in-one orchestrator for benchmark papers

- **Positioning**: built specifically for benchmark / evaluation papers; bundles the five-pillar framework (Research Gap, Construction Pipeline, Evaluation Framework, Empirical Findings, optional Companion Method) plus the six-stage workflow into a single skill.
- **When to trigger**:
  - Starting a benchmark project, thinking from "why does this benchmark need to exist"
  - Data has been collected, but the evaluation dimensions are fuzzy
  - Experiments are done; unclear whether each Finding-X insight is deep enough
  - Working through the benchmark-paper checklist before submission
- **Six stages**: Gap Analysis → Design → Construction Pipeline → Experiments → Paper Structure → Checklist. The skill **first detects the current stage**, then routes to the relevant thinking support.
- **Output**: per-stage deliverables + a six-part Introduction logic chain + a Section 2-7 skeleton + a pre-submission checklist.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [3.4 Benchmark and evaluation paper template](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.4_benchmark-paper-template.md) · [6.3 LEAD writing analysis](../handbook-en/06_Case_Studies/6.3_vldb2026-lead-analysis.md)
- **Cross-link**: figure-designer (the two core figures) · pre-submission-reviewer (final audit).

### benchmark-baseline-table — from domain survey to a maintainable comparison table

- **Positioning**: distils a domain survey into a **long-lived** SOTA/baseline comparison table (a Markdown constraint document plus an Excel data workbook, one writer per file), and freezes a reproducible baseline from it. It is neither a survey nor a leaderboard screenshot: every row must be able to answer "which table on which page did this number come from".
- **When to trigger**:
  - "Build the SOTA table for this domain" / "set up a folder to maintain this table long term"
  - "Which baselines in this field are reproducible today"
  - "Which methods have been run on benchmark Y, and what numbers did they report"
  - A literature sweep is finished and the results must become structured data rather than prose
  - A baseline must be frozen before your own experiments start
- **Key discipline**: **compare baselines before comparing numbers.** If a paper's reproduction of a public baseline (NPO or RMU, say) does not match the authoritative anchor value, every number in that paper is demoted to an isolated row and may not be compared with the main table. Missing data is written as "not reported", never invented. Non-standard metrics go into the setup-consistency note column, and a new column is never added.
- **Nine stages**: lock three preflight parameters (folder, delivery depth, benchmark scope) → define benchmarks and anchors → search along 3 to 5 complementary axes in parallel → archive PDFs through three validation gates → extract numbers with baseline reconciliation → produce deep-read notes → build A and B sheets → select the baseline (consistent caliber, reproducible, and modifiable, all three) → verify (full-text PDF re-check, column-count check, link probe).
- **Output**: constraint document, data workbook, helper scripts and a progress table; a full run additionally returns the numeric hit list, the structure-check report, and the evidence file for any marker that was challenged but not promoted.
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **deep-research** (map the field first); downstream is **paper-writer** (the table feeds Related Work and the experimental-setup section) and **pre-submission-reviewer** (the table enters the pre-submission audit).

### figure-designer — the design advisor for the three load-bearing figures

- **Positioning**: focuses on the three figures that carry the narrative weight of a technical paper — Motivated Example (Figure 1), Solution Overview (methodology), and Experimental Results — with design paradigms, layout rules, and tool-selection guidance.
- **When to trigger**:
  - Introduction outline is locked; you need to turn paragraph 1's Running Example into Figure 1
  - Before writing the methodology, decide how the Solution Overview figure should partition the module graph
  - Experiments are done, the main table is crowded, and a figure would tell the story better
  - Torn between PowerPoint, TikZ, and Inkscape
- **Key principles**: one figure says one thing; axis / legend / palette at top-venue aesthetic standards; the Experimental Results figure must speak directly back to the Introduction's motivation.
- **Output**: per-figure design notes, common anti-patterns, tool picks, and reusable layout templates.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [4.1 Motivated example figure](../handbook-en/04_Scientific_Plotting/4.1_motivated-example-figure.md) · [4.2 Solution overview figure](../handbook-en/04_Scientific_Plotting/4.2_solution-overview-figure.md) · [4.3 Experimental results figure](../handbook-en/04_Scientific_Plotting/4.3_experimental-results-figure.md) · [4.4 Plotting checklist](../handbook-en/04_Scientific_Plotting/4.4_plotting-checklist-and-tools.md)
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **intro-drafter** (running example locks Figure 1) and **tech-paper-template** (module graph locks the Solution Overview figure); downstream is **pre-submission-reviewer** (figure quality is part of the final audit).

### drawio-reconstruction — rebuild reference figures as editable Draw.io

- **Positioning**: an execution-oriented figure skill that reconstructs reference images, paper figures, architecture diagrams, slide diagrams, UI screenshots, or image folders into `.drawio` files with PNG previews and audit notes.
- **When to trigger**:
  - A target-style reference image already exists and the user needs an editable Draw.io version
  - Multiple figures need batch reconstruction into `.drawio`, each with visual-consistency checks
  - Text and structure should stay editable, while complex icons, screenshots, visual metaphors, and dense artwork should use faithful crops or transparent PNGs
- **Key discipline**: visual fidelity beats semantic approximation; script checks only prove XML and export validity, while final quality requires visual comparison against the reference.
- **Output**: `.drawio` source files, PNG previews, audit files for complex or batch tasks, and explicit notes for unresolved visual differences.
- **Attribution and license**: adapted from [drawio-reconstruction-skill](https://github.com/sxy1499894281/drawio-reconstruction-skill), retaining the MIT License.
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream can be a **figure-designer** plan or any user-provided reference image; downstream is **pre-submission-reviewer** for figure-quality review.

### paper-polish — meaning-preserving language polish

- **Positioning**: helps the author say **what the author means**, better, instead of replacing it with what the editor would have said. Grammar, word order, AI-tone removal, claim calibration, and Chinese-to-English rewriting at submission quality.
- **When to trigger**:
  - "Polish this passage / make it sound natural / strip the AI flavor"
  - "I wrote this in Chinese; turn it into submission-ready English"
  - "Is this claim too strong?"
- **Key discipline**: no edit that might change scientific meaning is ever made silently; such edits ship as a before/after list for the author to confirm; nothing absent from the original is added (no data, equations, citations, or mechanisms); conservative by default; when working on files, the edits land in the files and the version diff is the change record.
- **Output**: clean polished prose + three to five change notes, meaning-risk items listed side by side.
- **Matching handbook chapter**: [3.5 Writing details and checklist](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.5_writing-details-and-checklist.md)
- **Up- and downstream**: upstream is **paper-writer** / **intro-drafter** (drafts to polish); problems beyond language (broken logic, a doubtful core claim) route to **paper-writer** for redrafting or **pre-submission-reviewer** for a verdict.

### pre-submission-reviewer — the top-venue reviewer's final audit

- **Positioning**: simulates a top-venue reviewer and audits a draft across five dimensions: macro logic, writing details, English grammar, LaTeX formatting, figure quality.
- **When to trigger**:
  - 3 to 5 days before the submission deadline, running the final pass
  - Co-authors have stopped making suggestions; you need a cold-eyed full audit
  - Rebuttal is drafted; you want another sweep against the "things reviewers will flag" catalogue
- **Methodology**: severity tagging (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR) + reviewer-style writing checklist + high-frequency English pitfalls + common LaTeX formatting mistakes.
- **Output**: a severity-ranked defect list, each item paired with an actionable fix, with a clear **subset that is realistically fixable in 72 hours** called out.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [3.5 Writing details and checklist](../handbook-en/03_Paper_Writing/3.5_writing-details-and-checklist.md) · [1.1 How to evaluate paper quality](../handbook-en/01_Preliminary/1.1_how-to-evaluate-paper-quality.md)
- **Upstream**: the endpoint of the technical-paper track; also the endpoint of the benchmark-paper track.

### vibe-research-workflow — the always-on rules for AI-assisted research

- **Positioning**: a full-lifecycle guide for AI-assisted research, covering three sub-flows: Vibe Coding, Vibe Figure, Vibe Writing.
- **When to trigger**:
  - First time using Claude / Cursor / Codex to help with research code, unclear where the human-AI boundary is
  - Drawing a figure and torn between "let AI generate it" and "draw it yourself"
  - Worried the LLM is ghost-writing away your academic taste
  - The output feels like "the AI is winging it" — usually the behavioural rules are not aligned
- **Core principle**: **keep academic judgment in the human's hands, delegate mechanical labour to AI**; every AI output must come with checkable evidence; tool picks are per task type with a concrete shortlist.
- **Output**: a recommended tool chain for the current scenario, a human-AI division-of-labour sketch, and a common-failure-mode catalogue.
- **Matching handbook chapters**: [5.1 Vibe Research and Vibe Coding primer](../handbook-en/05_Vibe_Research/5.1_vibe-research-and-vibe-coding.md) · [5.2 Practitioner notes](../handbook-en/05_Vibe_Research/5.2_liboyan-practical-notes.md)
- **How it fits**: **orthogonal** to the other ten skills. It is not step N; it is a rulebook you pull up at any step. Drafting requests are legitimate: they route to paper-writer / intro-drafter, whose evidence discipline forbids fabricated substance; disclosure and per-passage verification duties stay with the author.

## How to actually use these skills

### Installed as Agent Skills (recommended)

Follow the [Quick Start](../README.en.md#quick-start) in the top-level README. Once installed, natural language triggers are enough, no commands to memorise. The following phrasings route to the matching skill:

- "survey this direction for me / literature review" → `deep-research`
- "help me evaluate this idea" → `idea-evaluator`
- "lock the paper's logical skeleton for me" → `tech-paper-template`
- "draft the Introduction / I want to write the intro" → `intro-drafter`
- "write this idea into a Discussion / draft the paper" → `paper-writer`
- "polish this / strip the AI flavor / turn my Chinese draft into submission English" → `paper-polish`
- "how should I draw this figure / what tool should I use" → `figure-designer`
- "rebuild this reference image as draw.io / generate editable drawio" → `drawio-reconstruction`
- "review the paper before I submit / final pass" → `pre-submission-reviewer`
- "I am writing a benchmark paper / I am doing an evaluation paper" → `benchmark-paper-template`
- "how do I use AI to assist my research" → `vibe-research-workflow`

### Without installation

Every `SKILL.md` is itself a readable, structured thinking checklist. You can:
- Paste SKILL.md into any AI assistant you use (Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, Kimi, and similar) as a system prompt
- Or treat it as a **static checklist** — no AI needed; pen, paper, and the section list are enough

Each skill's `references/` directory carries on-demand depth. For example, `idea-evaluator/references/five-dimensions.md` is the full expansion of the Higher-Faster-Stronger-Cheaper-Broader framework.

## Skill-to-handbook cross reference
